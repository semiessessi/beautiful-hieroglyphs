Build Instructions
------------------

Currently the only build pipeline is for Windows and uses Visual Studio.

If you have both, check out the repository recursively and open
Workspaces/beautiful-hieroglyphs.sln then press play or do a build.

There is only one configuration, and it builds all browser specific versions of
the plugin.

When complete a copy of the generic plugin version of the zip will be opened for
inspection.
